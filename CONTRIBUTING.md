Contributing
============

Guidelines
----------

* Make sure you follow PEP 008 style guide conventions. You can check PEP 008
  compliance with the included script: `docker-compose run --rm blacken`
* Commit messages should start with a capital letter ("Updated models", not "updated models").
* Write new tests and run old tests! Make sure that % test coverage does not decrease.
* Contributions are reviewed by a maintainer before acceptance. To facilitate
  review, please make a [pull request](https://github.com/openeemeter/eemeter/pulls/new)
  and provide a description and follow the checklist in the pull request template.
  Contributions without passing tests or with incomplete checklists will not
  be accepted. Tests will be automatically run using Travis CI after a pull
  request is created.
* Prefix new feature branches with `feature/` and bug fix branches with `fix`
  and make pull requests directly against `master`.
* Contributions that add new required dependencies to the library will be
  given a more thorough review to ensure that those dependency additions
  1) do not pose a security risk and 2) are absolutely necessary.
* Contributions that allow for data exfiltration by making external HTTP or TCP
  requests will not be accepted.

Contributor maintenance responsibility
--------------------------------------

Contributions of all kinds are encouraged, and we do not require contributors
to be responsible for ongoing support of patches they make. However, because
we accept "toss over the wall" contributions, contributions deemed by the
maintainers to be too difficult to maintain will not be accepted.

Testing
-------

Please write unit tests for all new features. At time of writing, this
package has 100% test coverage. We would like to maintain that coverage level,
because 100% coverage is easier than 99% coverage. This does not necessarily
mean that all line are tested. For lines that are sufficiently inconvenient to
test, we maintain 100% test coverage by adding `# pragma: no cover` comments
after the difficult to test lines or blocks.

This helps us stay on top of un-covered sections without sacrificing the
convenience of 100% coverage and without being too overbearing about tests.

Tests are run using the following commands (flags are passed to the py.test
executable):

```
docker-compose run --rm test                         # run all tests

# cheat sheet of variations
docker-compose run --rm test --no-cov                # no coverage
docker-compose run --rm test tests/test_features.py  # run a specific suite
docker-compose run --rm test -k compute              # filter for tests with `compute` in the name
```

Test configuration can be found in `tox.ini`, `pytest.ini`, and `tests/conftest.py`.

Travis CI configuration can be found in `.travis.yml`.

When writing tests using py.test fixtures, place fixtures as close as possible
to the test functions or classes that call them.

Release process
---------------

Pre-release

1. create branch off of master named `feature/<examplefeature>` or `bugfix/<>` and make desired changes.
2. edit CHANGELOG.md with changes under a new section called `Development`
3. create, review, and merge PR for feature/examplefeature
4. repeat steps 1-3 if desired for other features as convenient, though preference is for frequent version bumps

Releasing

5. make a new branch called release/vX.X.X
6. bump version - edit `__version__.py` with the new version
7. Rename `Development` section with the new version in CHANGELOG.md
8. commit changes
9. create a tag called vX.X.X on release/vX.X.X branch
10. push tag and branch
11. submit to pypi with `pipenv run python setup.py upload` (must have proper credentials)
12. merge release branch to master

Release command cheatsheet

```
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout -b release/vX.X.X

# then bump versions
vim eemeter/__version__.py
vim CHANGELOG.md
git commit -sam "Bump version"

git tag vX.X.X
git push -u origin release/vX.X.X --tags
docker-compose run --rm pipenv run python setup.py upload
git checkout master
git pull
git merge release/vX.X.X
git push
```

Or, you can use the `bump_verion.sh` to print out versions of these commands
that are populated with the appropriate version number.

```
./bump_version.sh X.X.X Y.Y.Y
```
