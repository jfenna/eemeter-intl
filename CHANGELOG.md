Changelog
=========

Development
-----------

* Placeholder

* 3.1.2
-----

* Addition of modules and amendments in support of international facility for EEMeter, including principally:
* Addition of processing.py; updating setup.py and __init__/py accordingly.
* Amendments to design_matrices; features; and derivatives.
* Addition of new tests and samples.
* Amendments to tutorial.ipynb.
* Addition of eemeter international.ipynb.


3.1.1
-----


* Update observed_mean calculation to account for solar (negative usage) to provide
sensible cvrmse calculations.

3.1.0
-----

* Remove missing hour_of_week categories in the CalTrack hourly methods so they predict null for those hours. 

3.0.0
-----

* Remove python27 support.
* Update Pipfile lock.
* Update `fit_temperature_bins` to potentially take an `occupancy_lookup` in order to
  fit different temperature bins for occupied/unoccupied modes. *This changes the args passed to eemeter.create_caltrack_hourly_segmented_design_matrices, where it now requires a set of bins for occupied and unoccupied temperatures separately.*
* Update CalTRACK hourly model formula to use different bins for occupied and
  unoccupied mode.

  ` with_design_matrix=True` flag set for caltrack usage per day methods.

2.5.4-post1
-----------

* Update MANIFEST.in to fix release and update `./bump_version.sh` script
  to remove build directories.

2.5.4
-----

-----------

* Fix release .whl file which had some extra directories.
* Add draft MAINTAINERS.md.

2.5.3
-----

* Fix `metered_savings` behavior so that it does not fail to compute error bands when there is 0 variance in the baseline.

  `get_baseline_data` and `get_reporting_data` methods.

* Fix in `transform.get_baseline_data` and `transform.get_reporting_data` to enable pulling a full year of data even with irregular billing periods

2.1.3
-----

* Fix bug related to caltrack billing design matrix creation during empty temperature traces.

  savings.

  column to facilitate weighted least squares.
